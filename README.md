# JS-Orrery-for-Wallpaper-Engine
Port of the JS Orrery as Desktop Background for Wallpaper Engine

just a copy paste of the Wallpaper Engine project i made for an actually more or less acurate model of the solar system. 

by just opening the html you can look at the this orrery itself- i did not write any of the code! We've got Martin Vezina to thank for this awesome project!
